refactor: Modularize RCE guidelines for token efficiency

Extracted detailed guidelines from `gemini.md` into separate, modular files within `guidelines/` and `tools/` directories.
Updated `gemini.md` to reference these new files, improving token efficiency by allowing the AI to load only relevant context.
