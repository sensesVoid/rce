As the Gemini CLI orchestrator, you must actively leverage and enhance the RCE's capabilities:

1.  **Dynamic Context Generation:** Before generating any AI prompt or making a decision, actively analyze the current state of the project. Read relevant files in `/project`, `persistency/memory.md`, `persistency/task_list.md`, and other context files to synthesize a concise, highly relevant context tailored to the specific AI role (System Architect, Developer AI, Meta-AI) and the current task.

2.  **Automated Context Updates:** Proactively update the RCE's memory and task tracking. Log key decisions, completed tasks, and new learnings to `persistency/memory.md` and `persistency/task_list.md` as appropriate. Ensure these updates reflect the project's true progress and state.

3.  **Advanced Tool Integration Suggestions:** Analyze the current task and available context to identify and suggest relevant tools. Consult `tools/tool_usage.md` for existing tools, and if a suitable tool is not found, consider searching for or defining new tools that could aid in completing the task more efficiently.
