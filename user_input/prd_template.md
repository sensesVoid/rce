-   **Autonomous Task Execution:** Agents can perform a wide array of online tasks, including:
    -   Writing, editing, and posting content (blogs, social media, video scripts).
    -   Scraping, parsing, and analyzing web data from various sources.
    -   Sending personalized emails or social media messages.
    -   Managing and updating content on digital platforms (e.g., YouTube, Medium, Reddit).
    -   Triggering other tools and workflows via APIs (e.g., Zapier, Make, Google Apps Script).
-   **Self-Replication Logic:** Agents possess the capability to spawn new instances (replicate) based on:
    -   Completion of a task that requires follow-up.
    -   Detection of new opportunities or specific data signals.
    -   Meeting predefined schedules or conditional triggers.
    -   Replication involves spawning a new task-specific AI agent instance with inherited context and purpose.
-   **Contextual Intelligence:** Each agent is endowed with:
    -   A clear goal or objective to guide its actions.
    -   A scoped memory or context (e.g., Google Sheets row, JSON payload, local file, vector database) for relevant information.
    -   A dynamic set of tools (APIs, custom scripts, browser automation capabilities) to achieve its objectives.
-   **Web-Native Existence:** Agents are designed to live and operate entirely in the cloud, leveraging:
    -   Hosting on free or low-cost serverless platforms (e.g., Google Apps Script, Hugging Face Spaces, GitHub Actions).
    -   Communication via webhooks, APIs, or data queues for inter-agent and external system interaction.
    -   Interface capabilities with web browsers using tools like Puppeteer, Playwright, or Browserflow for complex web interactions.
-   **Fully Automated Ecosystem:** The system operates with minimal to no human input once initialized, characterized by:
    -   All logic being rule-based, data-triggered, or prompt-driven.
    -   Exclusive use of free tools and serverless environments to maintain zero-capital overhead.
    -   Self-healing capabilities, including debugging mechanisms and automated retries for failed steps.
-   **System Architecture Components:**
    -   **Agent Factory (Spawner/Orchestrator):** Reads tasks/goals from a queue (e.g., Google Sheet, Firebase) and spawns agents based on predefined templates.
    -   **Agent Kernel (Core Agent Logic):** Contains the reasoning and execution engine (LLM + tools), stores logs, output, and spawn triggers.
    -   **Memory Layer:** Utilizes Google Sheets or vector databases to store task results, conversation history, and performance logs, enabling learning and optimization.
    -   **Replication Triggers:** Implements rule-based ("If success, spawn next"), data-based ("If new lead, create follow-up agent"), and time-based (cron jobs) triggers.

**Out of Scope (for this version):**
-   Advanced machine learning for agent self-improvement beyond rule-based or data-triggered optimization.
-   Integration with proprietary or high-cost hosting platforms and tools.
-   Direct, real-time human interaction with agents post-initialization (beyond monitoring logs and outputs).
