# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Boilerplate

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** AI Customer Support Widget
**One-Liner:** An embeddable AI-powered widget that provides real-time customer support through voice calls, following strict call flows and product policies while leveraging RAG and vector databases for accurate, contextual responses.

## 2. Problem Statement

**What problem is this project solving?**
Businesses struggle to provide consistent, accurate, and scalable customer support through phone calls. Current solutions either lack the ability to maintain strict adherence to company policies, suffer from inconsistent responses across different agents, or require extensive human resources that don't scale cost-effectively. Companies need a way to provide immediate, policy-compliant voice support that can access their knowledge base in real-time.

**Why is it important to solve?**
Poor customer support experiences lead to customer churn, increased operational costs, and brand damage. Traditional call centers are expensive to scale and maintain consistency across agents. An AI solution that can provide instant, accurate, and policy-compliant responses will reduce support costs, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure consistent brand representation across all customer interactions.

## 3. Goals & Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Create an embeddable AI widget that delivers fast, accurate, and policy-compliant customer support through real-time voice interactions.

**Key Objectives (SMART):**
- **Objective 1:** Achieve sub-2-second response times for 90% of customer queries within 6 months of launch
- **Objective 2:** Maintain 95% policy compliance rate across all customer interactions by Q2 2025
- **Objective 3:** Enable businesses to deploy the widget with their custom knowledge base within 24 hours of setup
- **Objective 4:** Process 1000+ concurrent voice calls per deployment by Q3 2025
- **Objective 5:** Achieve 85% customer satisfaction score in post-call surveys within 3 months
