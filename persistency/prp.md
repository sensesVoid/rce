# Prompt Engineering Plan (PRP)

## Meta-Instructions for AI

- **Role:** Expert AI Customer Support Widget Developer
- **Objective:** Develop a fully functional AI Customer Support Widget based on the provided Product Requirements Document (PRD).
- **Format:** Generate code, tests, and documentation in markdown format.
- **Constraints:** Adhere strictly to the provided PRD. Read and adhere to the `system_prompt.md` as its primary directive, and all other files in the `/guidelines/` directory for every task. Ensure all code is well-documented, follows best practices, and is placed in the `/project` directory.

## Context

**Project Background:**
The project aims to create an embeddable AI-powered widget that provides real-time customer support through voice calls. It will follow strict call flows and product policies, leveraging RAG and vector databases for accurate, contextual responses. The primary problem it solves is the struggle businesses face in providing consistent, accurate, and scalable customer support through phone calls, aiming to reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, and ensure consistent brand representation.

**Key Files & Schemas:**
- `/project/`: Main directory for all generated application code.
- `/persistency/`: Contains memory, task lists, and RAG documents.
- `/guidelines/`: Contains project-specific guidelines and standards.
- `user_input/prd_template.md`: The source Product Requirements Document.
- `system_prompt.md`: Primary directive for the AI.

**Current State:**
Initial project setup. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) has been analyzed. No application code has been generated yet.

## Task Definition

**Input:**
The Product Requirements Document (PRD) provided in `user_input/prd_template.md`.

**Process:**
The development will proceed in phases, addressing the core features outlined in the PRD. Each phase will involve designing, coding, testing, and documenting the respective components.

1.  **Phase 1: Core Voice Processing & Widget Foundation**
    *   **Task:** Implement real-time voice processing capabilities (WebRTC, STT, TTS).
    *   **Task:** Develop the basic embeddable widget structure (React.js/HTML/CSS/JS).
    *   **Task:** Set up initial project structure within `/project`.

2.  **Phase 2: Knowledge Base & RAG Integration**
    *   **Task:** Design and implement Knowledge Base Management (upload, storage).
    *   **Task:** Integrate with a Vector Database (Pinecone/Chroma) for RAG.
    *   **Task:** Develop the RAG integration logic for real-time information retrieval.

3.  **Phase 3: Call Flow Engine & AI Orchestration**
    *   **Task:** Implement the configurable Call Flow Engine for policy compliance.
    *   **Task:** Integrate AI Models (OpenAI GPT-4/Claude) with RAG capabilities.
    *   **Task:** Develop the backend AI orchestration logic (Python with LangChain/LangGraph).

4.  **Phase 4: Analytics & Monitoring**
    *   **Task:** Design and implement the Analytics Dashboard for monitoring call volume, response times, etc.

5.  **Phase 5: Advanced Features & Integrations**
    *   **Task:** Implement Multi-language Support.
    *   **Task:** Develop the Escalation System for human agent handoff.
    *   **Task:** Implement Custom Voice Options.
    *   **Task:** Explore and integrate with relevant third-party services (e.g., Webhook integrations for CRM).

6.  **Phase 6: Non-Functional Requirements & Testing**
    *   **Task:** Ensure all implemented features meet performance, security, scalability, and usability requirements.
    *   **Task:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all components.
    *   **Task:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure policy compliance and accurate responses.

7.  **Phase 7: Documentation & Finalization**
    *   **Task:** Generate user-facing documentation for widget integration and knowledge base management.
    *   **Task:** Prepare the `/project` directory for final export.
